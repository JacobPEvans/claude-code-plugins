# Resolve CodeQL

Fix CodeQL alerts in **current repository only** by analyzing, classifying, and delegating to specialized agents.

## Scope Options

| Usage | Scope | Batch Size |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| `/resolve-codeql` | List all alerts | N/A |
| `/resolve-codeql fix` | Fix all alerts | 5 |
| `/resolve-codeql type:permissions` | Permissions alerts only | 5 |
| `/resolve-codeql type:injection` | Expression injection only | 5 |
| `/resolve-codeql type:other` | Other alert types | 5 |
| `/resolve-codeql file:path/to/workflow.yml` | Specific file only | N/A |

## Related

- `codeql-expression-injector` agent - Mitigate injection vulnerabilities
- `codeql-generic-resolver` agent - Handle other alert types
- `codeql-permission-classification` skill - Permission requirements
- `github-workflow-security-patterns` skill - Security patterns

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Alert Discovery & Classification

```bash
gh api repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/code-scanning/alerts \
  --jq '.[] | select(.state == "open") | {
    number,
    rule: .rule.id,
    severity: .rule.severity,
    location: .most_recent_instance.location.path,
    message: .most_recent_instance.message.text
  }'
```

Group results by rule type:
- `actions/missing-workflow-permissions` → Permissions category
- `actions/expression-injection` → Expression injection category
- Others → Generic category

Apply scope filter (if provided):
- `type:permissions`, `type:injection`, `type:other`
- `file:<path>` - only alerts in specific file

Report: N permissions, N injection, N other

### Phase 2: Delegate to Specialists

Based on alert classification:

```
Permissions alerts (0-N)
  ├─> Batch 1 (max 5) → codeql-permissions-auditor agent
  ├─> Batch 2 (max 5) → codeql-permissions-auditor agent
  └─> ...

Expression injection alerts (0-N)
  ├─> Batch 1 (max 5) → codeql-expression-injector agent
  └─> ...

Other alerts (0-N)
  └─> Batch 1 (max 5) → codeql-generic-resolver agent
```

Invoke `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` for parallel execution patterns.

Each agent receives:
- Alert numbers (array)
- File paths affected
- Instructions to fix, commit, and return summary

### Phase 3: Verification & Reporting

After all agents complete:

1. Re-run alert discovery
2. Compare before/after counts
3. Verify fixes committed to local branch
4. Report summary:
   ```
   CodeQL Resolution Report
   ======================
   Repository: {OWNER}/{REPO}

   FIXED:
   - 8 alerts in .github/workflows/ci-gate.yml
   - 0 alerts in .github/workflows/deploy.yml

   NEEDS REVIEW:
   - 2 alerts in .github/workflows/notify.yml

   Total: 8 fixed, 2 needs review

   Next steps:
   1. Verify all fixes: git diff
   2. Create PR: /finalize-pr
   ```

## Success Criteria

- ✓ All permissible alerts are fixed
- ✓ Changes are committed with descriptive messages
- ✓ CodeQL verification confirms alerts resolved
- ✓ No new alerts introduced by fixes

## Error Handling

- If GitHub API unavailable: Report error, don't proceed
- If agent fails 3 times: Mark PR/file as "needs human review"
- If alert is unresolvable: Flag "escalation needed" with analysis
- If workspace has uncommitted changes: Abort with warning

## Notes

- Always use least-privilege principle for permissions
- Expression injection fixes must follow GitHub's official guidance
- Unclear patterns → Escalate for human review, don't guess
- Each fix should be a separate commit per alert or file
