# CodeQL Permissions Auditor

Fix "Workflow does not contain permissions" CodeQL alerts by analyzing and adding explicit permission blocks to GitHub Actions jobs.

## Input

```
{
  "alerts": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      "location": ".github/workflows/ci-gate.yml",
      "line_number": 103,
      "message": "Actions job or workflow does not limit the permissions..."
    },
    ...
  ],
  "batch_size": 5
}
```

## Workflow per Alert

### 1. Parse Alert Context

- Extract workflow file path and approximate line number
- Open the file and identify the job that needs fixing
- Check if job calls reusable workflow (`uses: ./.github/workflows/...`) or runs steps

### 2. Analyze Permission Requirements

**For reusable workflow calls:**

- Read the called workflow file (e.g., `./.github/workflows/_cclint.yml`)
- Extract all jobs within and their permission blocks
- Union all permissions from nested jobs
- Apply caller contract rule: "Caller must declare permissions for all jobs in callee"

**For regular step jobs:**

- Scan steps for which actions/tools are used
- Map each to required permissions:
  - `actions/checkout` → `contents: read`
  - `pull-requests` operations → `pull-requests: write`
  - `issues` operations → `issues: write`
  - `artifact` operations → `actions: read` or `contents: read`
  - Custom actions → Inspect action.yml for required permissions

### 3. Determine Minimum Permissions

Apply hierarchy:
1. Explicit permissions in reusable workflow → Required
2. GitHub actions used in steps → Required
3. Script operations (curl, git commands) → Usually `contents: read`
4. No operations at all → Empty `permissions: {}`

### 4. Apply Fix

Edit the workflow file:

```yaml
job-name:
  name: Display Name
  needs: changes                    # Original
  if: condition                     # Original
  permissions:                      # ← ADD THIS
    contents: read                  # Minimum
    pull-requests: write            # If needed
  uses: ./.github/workflows/_.yml   # Original
  with:                             # Original
    ...
```

Insert `permissions:` block after `if:` and before `uses:` or `steps:`.

### 5. Verify & Commit

- Run YAML linter to catch syntax errors: `yamllint <file>`
- Ensure no duplicate or conflicting permission declarations
- Commit with message: `"security: fix CodeQL #{alert_number} - add permissions to {job}"`

### 6. Return Summary

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "alert_number": 1,
      "file": ".github/workflows/ci-gate.yml",
      "job_name": "cclint",
      "permissions_added": {
        "contents": "read"
      },
      "status": "fixed",
      "commit_sha": "abc123..."
    }
  ],
  "failed": [],
  "needs_review": []
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Reusable Workflow Call (Most Common)

```yaml
# BEFORE (alert)
cclint:
  name: Claude Code Lint
  needs: changes
  if: condition
  uses: ./.github/workflows/_cclint.yml

# AFTER (fixed)
cclint:
  name: Claude Code Lint
  needs: changes
  if: condition
  permissions:
    contents: read
  uses: ./.github/workflows/_cclint.yml
```

### Pattern 2: PR Comment Operation

```yaml
# BEFORE (alert)
validate:
  name: Validation
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v6
    - run: validate.sh | tee result.txt
    - uses: actions/github-script@v7
      with:
        script: |
          github.rest.issues.createComment({...})

# AFTER (fixed)
validate:
  name: Validation
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  permissions:
    contents: read
    pull-requests: write  # For github.rest.issues.createComment
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v6
    - run: validate.sh | tee result.txt
    - uses: actions/github-script@v7
      with:
        script: |
          github.rest.issues.createComment({...})
```

### Pattern 3: No Permissions Needed

```yaml
# BEFORE (alert)
gate:
  name: Merge Gate
  needs: [cclint, validate]
  if: always()
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: some-aggregator-action@v1

# AFTER (fixed)
gate:
  name: Merge Gate
  needs: [cclint, validate]
  if: always()
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  permissions: {}  # Explicitly no permissions needed
  steps:
    - uses: some-aggregator-action@v1
```

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Can't find job at line number | Flag "malformed_workflow" - needs human review |
| Reusable workflow not found | Flag "invalid_reference" - check file path |
| Can't determine permissions | Flag "needs_human_review" - provide analysis |
| YAML syntax error after fix | Flag "syntax_error" - rollback and report |
| Git commit fails | Flag "commit_failed" - check repo state |
